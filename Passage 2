The balance between nature and human lifestyle is important to protect the environment. Protecting the environment, atmosphere, and its various natural resources is crucial because environmental degradation can prove to be disastrous and threaten the very existence of life on earth.

Therefore, a clean and green environment should be maintained for a healthy life. The environment also directly affects humans and other living beings in several ways. People are adapted to living in certain climatic conditions and have figured out ways to deal with varying climatic conditions depending on where they live. Human beings are sensitive to their environment, and they are used to a certain temperature and changes, but extreme climate changes can affect their working environment and health directly. The environment can also create or reduce stress, which affects us in several ways. Natural processes or human activities have led to environmental disasters like volcanoes, earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, etc.
